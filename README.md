# üå∫ Jasi's Nix configs
Nix configs for macOS.

**Extremely** inspired by [@malob](https://github.com/malob)'s [Nix configs](https://github.com/malob/nixpkgs).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation
### ‚ú® Prerequisites
Install Nix
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```
---
It can happen that Nix fails to symlink the `/run` directory to `/private/var/run`. If so, execute this command:

Symlink /run to /var/run
```sh
echo 'run\tprivate/var/run' | sudo tee -a /etc/synthetic.conf
```
A restart is required after this step.

### üìÅ Clone this config
> Note: You need to have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed. As these dotfiles also require a homebrew installation, you can just install homebrew which automatically installs the Command Line Tools if they aren't installed yet. --> https://brew.sh/
> 
> Another note: If you want to put your configs somewhere else than in `~/.config`, you still need to create the [nix.conf](./nix/nix.conf) file under `~/.config/nix`.
```
git clone https://github.com/GiyoMoon/nix ~/.config
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è First time build
Until [this issue](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/issues/149) is fixed, you need to move your global `nix.conf`:
```sh
sudo mv /etc/nix/nix.conf /etc/nix/.nix-darwin.bkp.nix.conf
```
You only need to execute these commands one time. Make sure to restart your shell after this, or maybe even restart your MacBook for all configs to be applied.
```
cd ~/.config
```
```
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.JasisMacBook.system
```
```
sudo ./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#JasisMacBook
```

### üîÅ Update config
If you made any changes and want to update:
```
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#JasisMacBook
```

## üìã Todo
Things I want to expand this Nix config with:
- [ ] Install casks with homebrew
- [ ] Set default browser
- [ ] Git config
  - [ ] Name, email, signingKey etc.
  - [ ] Aliases
  - [ ] Configure a work directory
  - [ ] `git config --global pull.rebase true`
  - [ ] [@malob](https://github.com/malob)'s nice [git log alias](https://github.com/malob/nixpkgs/blob/46a480cd1edf687df81c1d5f0f2b8de8f15a5154/home/git-aliases.nix#L47)
- [ ] A nice shell setup with [fish](https://fishshell.com/) and [starship](https://starship.rs/)
