# üå∫ My Nix configs
Nix configs for macOS.

**Extremely** inspired by [@malob](https://github.com/malob)'s [Nix configs](https://github.com/malob/nixpkgs).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation
### ‚ú® Prerequisites
Install Nix
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```
---
It can happen that Nix fails to symlink the `/run` directory to `/private/var/run`. If so, execute this command:

Symlink /run to /var/run
```sh
echo 'run\tprivate/var/run' | sudo tee -a /etc/synthetic.conf
```
A restart is required after this step

---
Until [this issue](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/issues/149) is fixed, you need to move your global `nix.conf`:
```sh
sudo mv /etc/nix/nix.conf /etc/nix/.nix-darwin.bkp.nix.conf
```

### üìÅ Clone this config
> Note: You need to have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed. As these dotfiles also require a homebrew installation, you can just install homebrew which automatically installs the Command Line Tools if they aren't installed yet. --> https://brew.sh/
> 
> Another note: If you want to put your configs somewhere else than in `~/.config`, you still need to create the [nix.conf](./nix/nix.conf) file under `~/.config/nix`.
```
git clone https://github.com/GiyoMoon/nix ~/.config
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è First time build
You only need to execute these commands one time. Make sure to restart your shell after this, or maybe even log out and in again for all configs to be applied.
```
cd ~/.config
```
```
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.JasisMacBook.system
```
```
./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#JasisMacBook
```

### üîÅ Update config
If you made any changes and want to update:
```
darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#JasisMacBook
```

## üî¥ Troubleshooting
If you get the following error when running the `darwin-rebuild switch` command:
```
error: The ~/.nix-defexpr/channels symlink does not point your users channels, aborting activation
```
This happens because the `~/.nix-defexpr/channels` symlink points to the root channels, and not to your user's channels. To fix this:
```sh
sudo rm -r ~/.nix-defexpr
nix-channel --update
```
> **Important**: Don't run the `nix-channel` command as sudo, this would result into the same error again.

## üìã Todo
Things I want to expand this Nix config with:
- [x] Install casks with homebrew
- [x] Git config
  - [x] Name, email, signingKey etc.
  - [x] Aliases
  - [x] Configure a work directory
  - [x] `git config --global pull.rebase true`
  - [x] [@malob](https://github.com/malob)'s nice [git log alias](https://github.com/malob/nixpkgs/blob/46a480cd1edf687df81c1d5f0f2b8de8f15a5154/home/git-aliases.nix#L47)
- [ ] A nice shell setup with [fish](https://fishshell.com/) and [starship](https://starship.rs/)
- [ ] Set default browser
- [ ] Set login items
